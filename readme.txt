PPInfoScreen is a simple application which was made to archive some kind of
information screen. The Idea is simple. Place PowerPoint files into a shared
folder, name them with a date and time and let them show up automatically on
a server behind the physical screen.

I got 2 weeks for this project so I will not give any guarantee that it 
will work without any issues. However I guess it is quiet stable.

The program works very well at the moment. However you have to setup a share
and make the program start automatically by your own. This can be archived
with some basic knowledge
