PPInfoScreen is a tiny application to provide information on an information screen with 
a windows server behind. The main goal is to allow the administration to simply
put on any before made PowerPoint presentation and let it automatically slide over the
info screen at the time they want. 

This is a max. 2 weeks project. It just have to work quick and dirty and
as simple as possible.
